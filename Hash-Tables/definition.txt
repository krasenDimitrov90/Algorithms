Hash Table is like an object. We can imagine array with a length,
and key value pairs ("black", '#000000')
                        key     value
Then we use a hash function to hash the key, wich returns an index
which we use to store the pair in the array.
Because more then one key may return the same index, we store
the pairs in the a nested array coresponding to that index

[0  1  2  3]
0 - empty
1 - empty
2 - [[key,value], [key, value]]
3 - [[key, value]]

Definition from internet
A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, 
into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. 
During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the 
corresponding value is stored. Hash table. Type. Unordered associative array.
